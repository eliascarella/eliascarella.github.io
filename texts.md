I’m a frond-end developper with an eye for detail.<br>
I love working with the latest web technologies. Right now, I’m all about that sweet jamstack approach combined with a gaze on design and code rooted in a view for a greener and fairer web.<br><br>

So far, I’ve produced a <span class="italic">one-pager</span> for <a href="http://brigidabocini.com/" class="clientLink" id="brigidaBocini">Brigida Bocini</a>, a grid-based portfolio complete with a custom CMS for <a href="https://davidsentkar.com/" class="clientLink" id="davidSentkar">David Sentkar</a> and a place for <a href="http://alpinahuus.ch/" class="clientLink" id="alpinaHuus">Alpina Huus</a> to archive their projects. 



I am convinced we can make the web a better place by optimising the websites we produce and the design we embed on them. This allows for a better, faster and more efficient experience.
A big win-win. Check my <a href="https://www.are.na/elias-carella/ethical-web-working">are.na channel</a> if you want to get deeper.
